# SLDS ICONS FONT

This pack was created with [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) with [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com) 

You just have to import `style.css` and then add prefix icon names with `slds-icon-`

Icon names are referenced [here](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/).

## Example 

``` html

<i class="slds-icon-adduser" style="font-size:24px"/>
<i class="slds-icon-account" style="color:#2ecc71"/>

```

For better consistency, all icons have been scaled to the same size and color has been removed.
